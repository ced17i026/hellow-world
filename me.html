  <h1>Early Life</h1>
   <p>
     I was born in Nalanda district of Bihar.And as my mother say it's been only week after which my whole family<br />
     moved to Delhi for five years and in absence of my father my grandfather was building our house in Bihar<br />
     And when we came to Bihar for inaugration of our new home, my grandmother asked my father to start living<br />
     in Bihar and finally after five years our whole family shifted to Bihar.
   </p>
  <h1>Education</h1>
   <p>
    First when we shifted to Bihar, i was enrolled to a private school near my home as at that time parents didn't<br />
    wanted to send their child very far.That's why i was not enrolled in my relative's school and it's only been <br />
    two month when i shifted to another school cause i lied my grandfather that they have registigated from their<br />
    school.
    
    Then when i was to shifted in another school my father came to home and told my grandfather that he gonna take<br />
    me to boarding school. And then all of a sudden i started living in boarding school when i was only of six.
